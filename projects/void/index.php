				<h1>The Void Above</h1>
				<h3>Spring 2013 | Criticial Design, Experimental</h3>
				<p>"I don't want to be neither here nor there." This is the premise behind The Void Above. The object is a means of escape, bringing the physical world into gradual obscurity. Though you have left reality, you haven't quite arrived anywhere else, thus entering a void.</p>
				<p>This project is a response to the constant stimuli and pressures of the world around us. Sensory deprivation and meditation go hand in hand, allowing the user to free himself both physically and mentally. Though not practical in its real-world application, The Void Above functions as an object of Design Noir, a critique of the role of design and its purpose in society.</p>
