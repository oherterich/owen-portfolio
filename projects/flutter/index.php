				<h1>Flutter</h1>
				<h3>Spring 2014 | openFrameworks, Arduino</h3>
				<p>Flutter is an installation where visitors use their breath to control what's in front of them. A recent tweet is shown on the screen. Blow hard enough, and the next one appears.</p>
				<p>Because of the versatility of the hardware and software implementation, Flutter can exist in a multitude of different environments. It could feel just at home in a sponsored event as it could in a gallery setting. Data from any source could be visualized on screen, and the visual aesthetic is built to be rapidly configured and customized.</p>
				<p>This project was created with <a href="http://anantapa.tumblr.com/">Anantapa Thongtawach</a>. I did the majority of the software development, as well as the interfacing between software and hardware. Flutter was created with openFrameworks and Arduino, using serial communication and the lovely <a href="https://github.com/bakercp/ofxOAuth">ofxOAuth</a> addon.</p>
